# SocialUniversity
For university students, our application will help them to communicate with their 
colleagues in the same department and the same university. and they can also find the
required resources to help them on their study and saving their time instead of spent their
time searching on these resources in different places. in addition, if any student 
Interested in finding a suitable job he can browse the job opportunities section to find
a suitable job if he want to work while he is studying or after his graduation.
the students can post or ask anything on the main channel or their department group to 
help each other and exchanging their information.
